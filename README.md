Hi!

I'm a hobbyist programmer who started creating games with flash in AS 2.0.   In highschool I started diving into
object based languages which paved the way to learning AS 3 and finally bringing those tools in learning Java 
to play around in Android.

One of my Profs in the Interactive Media Design program (formerly DMA) suggested we get github so I wanted to see what the hoopla was about as I was generally relying on tutorials and good old stackoverlow.
